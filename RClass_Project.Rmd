# I really like the way you used "::" to call a single function from the janitor package! Really neat trick that I often forget about. Thanks for the reminder! However, if I remember correctly, if you do this you don't actually need to load the package above.

# You may consider including the text "setup" or something similar to name this code chunk.

# The way in which your code is written necessitates a lot of objects. I wonder if you could use the pipe to string more functions together, which would lessen the number of objects you need to create. I would also recommend making sure your object names are meaningful, as I wasn't totally clear on the reason for "wide" vs. "wide1", for example. Meaningful object names will make it more likely that you'll remember what to do with each of these objects once they are created!
